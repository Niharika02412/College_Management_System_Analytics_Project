# College_Management_System_Analytics_Project
College management system analysis using SQL and Power BI to evaluate student performance, faculty workload, course distribution, and enrollment trends for data-driven academic decision-making.

## 📌 Project Overview
The College Management System Analytics project focuses on improving the operational and academic efficiency of a college by analyzing structured datasets related to students, faculty, courses, and enrollments.
The institution’s data was previously maintained across spreadsheets and manual records, making it difficult to track performance and trends. This project uses SQL for data analysis and Power BI for visualization to enable data-driven decision-making.

## 🛠 Tools
- SQL (Data Analysis & Querying)
- Power BI (Dashboards & Visualizations)
- Excel / CSV Datasets

## 📂 Datasets Used
- **Students Table** – Student details and academic information  
- **Faculty Table** – Instructor details, department, and salary  
- **Courses Table** – Course information and credits  
- **Enrollments Table** – Student enrollment and grades  

## 🔍 SQL Analysis Performed
- Calculated average grade for each student using a grade-to-points system (A=4, B=3, C=2, D=1, F=0)  
- Analyzed average instructor salary by department  
- Identified courses taught by more than one instructor  
- Listed instructors teaching courses with fewer than 3 enrolled students  
- Calculated total credits earned by each student grouped by major  
- Identified top 3 students based on total credits earned

## 📊 Power BI Dashboard Insights
- Course-wise student enrollment trends  
- Department-wise faculty distribution and salary comparison  
- Student progression analysis based on credit accumulation  
- Active vs graduated student proportion analysis  
- Academic performance and resource utilization insights  

## 🎯 Business / Academic Impact
- Helps assess student academic performance and progression  
- Supports faculty workload and salary analysis  
- Improves course planning and enrollment monitoring  
- Enables management to make data-driven academic decisions  
- Enhances transparency across departments
